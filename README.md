This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The code in `bug.rs` attempts to have two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x` simultaneously. This violates Rust's borrowing rules and results in a compile-time error. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.rs`, demonstrates how to refactor the code to avoid this error.
